# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

A minimal tutorial that turns smart non-coders into proficient coders using AI. See RFC-0001A.txt for full vision.

## Structure

```
README.md           # Entry point
chapters/
  01-start-here.md  # Setup and first code
  02-core-skills.md # Essential skills
  03-build-things.md # Real projects
RFC-0001A.txt       # Project vision
```

## Writing Conventions

- No tool branding or product names in tutorial content
- Present AI-assisted coding as simply "coding"
- Every sentence must earn its place - no filler
- Assume reader is intelligent but has zero coding experience
- Focus on practical outcomes, not theory
