PROJECT VISION
==============

A tutorial that turns smart non-coders into pro-level coders using AI.

TARGET AUDIENCE
- Intelligent professionals who don't code (engineers, scientists, analysts)
- People who solve complex problems in their field but never learned programming
- Fast learners who want results, not theory

CORE PHILOSOPHY
1. AI-assisted coding is presented as simply "coding" - the default, not an alternative
2. No mention of tool names, competing products, or "traditional" methods
3. No implication that there's another way to do this
4. Reader thinks: "This is how people code" not "This is how to use X tool"

APPROACH
- Assume intelligence, not coding knowledge
- Shortest path from zero to productive
- Every sentence earns its place - no filler
- Practical outcomes over concepts
- Learn by doing, not reading

WHAT TO AVOID
- Tool branding or product names
- Comparisons to other methods/tools
- Unnecessary technical background
- Anything that doesn't directly advance skill
- "Tips", "best practices", padding

SUCCESS METRIC
A mechanical engineer finishes this tutorial and builds real software.
They never wondered "what tool is this" - they just learned to code.
