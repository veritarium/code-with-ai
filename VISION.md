# VISION

## Goal

Turn smart non-coders into proficient AI coders.

## Method

**Teach with drawings. Text explains drawings.**

Like a machine design textbook:
- Drawings carry the information
- Text supports what you see
- Dense but not overloaded

## Information Design Principles

Every drawing works at three levels:

```
GLANCE (3 sec)     STUDY (30 sec)      MASTER (5 min)
See the shape      Understand flow     Know all details
```

Drawing quality:
- Every element earns its place
- Clear visual hierarchy
- White space is intentional
- No decoration
- Progressive disclosure

## Target Audience

Intelligent professionals who don't code:
- Engineers, scientists, analysts
- Fast learners who want results
- People who understand complex diagrams

## Core Philosophy

1. AI does the hard work, not the user
2. Drawings are primary, text is secondary
3. Dense information, not dense difficulty
4. No tool branding in teaching content
5. This is just "how coding works"

## Success Metric

A mechanical engineer studies these drawings and builds real software.
The same way they'd study assembly drawings and build a machine.

| # | Drawing | Concept |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | The Core | You + AI = Software |
| 2 | The Loop | Describe → Get → Run → Refine |
| 3 | Decomposition | Big → Small pieces |
| 4 | Operations | Create / Read / Edit / Run / Fix |
| 5 | Context | What AI can see |
| 6 | Specificity | Vague → Precise spectrum |
| 7 | Iteration | Draft → Refine → Better |
| 8 | Pipeline | Data flow pattern |
| 9 | Web App | Component pattern |
| 10 | Build | Start small → Verify → Extend |
