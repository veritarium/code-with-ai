# Start Here

## Install

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Don't have npm? Install Node.js first from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## Launch

Navigate to any folder and type:

```bash
claude
```

First time? Follow the login prompt in your browser.

## Your First Code

Once you're in, type:

```
Create a Python script that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
```

Watch it write the code. Then:

```
Run it with 100 degrees
```

You just coded.

## How This Works

You describe what you want in plain English. The AI writes the code, creates files, and runs commands. You guide it with feedback.

That's the entire model. Everything else is refinement.
