# Core Skills

## Being Specific

Vague requests get vague results.

**Weak:** `Make a website`

**Strong:** `Create an HTML page with a form that collects name and email, then shows a thank you message when submitted`

Include what you know: file names, function purposes, expected behavior.

## Working with Files

**Read:**
```
Show me what's in config.json
```

**Create:**
```
Create a file called utils.py with a function that validates email addresses
```

**Edit:**
```
In utils.py, add a function that formats phone numbers as (XXX) XXX-XXXX
```

**Search:**
```
Find all files that contain the word "password"
```

## Running Commands

**Install dependencies:**
```
Install the requests library
```

**Run your code:**
```
Run main.py
```

**Run tests:**
```
Run the tests and tell me what failed
```

**Check status:**
```
Show me the git status
```

## Iterating

First attempt rarely perfect. Refine:

```
The email validation isn't catching emails without dots in the domain. Fix that.
```

```
Add error handling for when the file doesn't exist
```

```
Make it faster by caching the results
```

## Understanding Code

When you inherit code or forget what something does:

```
Explain what this project does
```

```
How does the login function work?
```

```
What would happen if I delete this file?
```

## Multi-Step Tasks

Break complex work into steps:

```
First, show me the structure of this project
```

```
Now add a new endpoint for user registration
```

```
Write tests for the endpoint you just created
```

```
Run the tests and fix any failures
```

## Fixing Errors

When something breaks:

```
I got this error: [paste error]. Fix it.
```

```
The tests are failing. Show me why and fix them.
```

```
The app crashes when I click submit. Debug it.
```

## Commands Reference

Built-in commands start with `/`:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Start fresh conversation |
| `/cost` | Show usage stats |
