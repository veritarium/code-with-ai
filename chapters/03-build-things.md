# Build Things

Learn by building. Pick a project and go.

## Project 1: Data Processor

Turn messy data into clean reports.

```
Create a Python script that:
1. Reads a CSV file called "data.csv"
2. Removes rows with missing values
3. Calculates the average of the "price" column
4. Saves results to "report.txt"
```

Then test it:
```
Create a sample data.csv with 10 rows including some missing values, then run the script
```

## Project 2: File Organizer

Automate tedious file management.

```
Create a script that:
1. Scans a folder for all files
2. Moves images to an "images" subfolder
3. Moves documents to a "docs" subfolder
4. Moves everything else to "other"
```

## Project 3: Web Scraper

Extract information from websites.

```
Create a Python script that:
1. Fetches the page at [some URL]
2. Extracts all the headlines
3. Saves them to headlines.txt
```

## Project 4: Simple API

Build a web service.

```
Create a REST API with:
1. GET /items - returns a list of items
2. POST /items - adds a new item
3. DELETE /items/{id} - removes an item

Use Flask and store data in memory.
```

Test it:
```
Start the API and test each endpoint with curl
```

## Project 5: Automation Script

Automate a repetitive task.

```
Create a script that:
1. Watches a folder for new PDF files
2. When one appears, extracts the text
3. Emails me a summary

Set it up to run in the background.
```

## Project 6: Dashboard

Visualize your data.

```
Create a web dashboard that:
1. Reads data from results.json
2. Shows a bar chart of values by category
3. Updates when the file changes

Use HTML, JavaScript, and Chart.js.
```

## Your Own Project

Now build something you actually need.

Think about:
- What repetitive task do you do weekly?
- What data do you wish was easier to analyze?
- What tool would save you hours?

Describe it clearly and start building.

## When You Get Stuck

```
I'm trying to [goal] but [problem]. Help me fix it.
```

```
This isn't working: [paste code or error]. What's wrong?
```

```
I don't understand what this error means: [error message]
```

## Next Steps

You have the skills. Now it's practice.

Build things you need. Break them. Fix them. Build more.

Every project makes you faster.
