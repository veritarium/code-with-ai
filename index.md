## What You'll Learn

You'll learn to build working software using AI as your coding partner. No programming experience required.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Describe what you need and get working code
- Debug errors without understanding every line
- Build real tools that solve real problems
- Know when to trust AI and when to verify

## The Core Insight

**You provide direction. AI provides code. Together, you build.**

You're not replacing yourself with AI. You're amplifying yourself. Think of it like power tools—a nail gun doesn't replace the carpenter, it makes the carpenter faster.
