Let's start with the most important concept in this entire tutorial.

You don't need to become a programmer. You need to become a *builder*.

*Figure 1.1: The Core — You and AI collaborate through prompts to create software*
{: .diagram-caption}

Look at this diagram. There are four elements here, and they form a partnership.

**YOU** — that's you, the engineer. You bring domain knowledge, judgment, and the ability to know what you actually need. You understand bolt stress calculations. You know what a valid engineering result looks like. You know what problem needs solving.

**AI** — this is your coding partner. It knows syntax, patterns, and can generate code quickly. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't judge your questions. But it doesn't know *your* problem unless you tell it.

**PROMPT** — this is the bridge. The prompt is how you communicate with AI. The quality of your prompt determines the quality of what you get back. We'll spend a lot of time on this.

**SOFTWARE** — this is the output. Working code that solves your problem. This is what we're building toward.

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> You provide direction. AI provides code. Together, you build.
</div>

You're not replacing yourself with AI. You're amplifying yourself. Think of it like power tools — a nail gun doesn't replace the carpenter, it makes the carpenter faster.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to describe what you need and get working code. Not perfect code. Not beautiful code. *Working* code that solves real problems.
