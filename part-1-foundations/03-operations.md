Everything you'll ever do with AI coding falls into six categories. Just six.

**CREATE** — Making something new. "Create a function that..." or "Build a script that..."

**READ** — Understanding existing code. "Explain what this function does" or "What does line 15 mean?"

**EDIT** — Changing existing code. "Modify this to also handle..." or "Change the output format to..."

**RUN** — Executing code and seeing results. You do this part — AI can't run code for you.

**FIX** — Debugging errors. "I'm getting this error: [error message]. Here's the code. Fix it."

**EXTEND** — Adding to existing code. "Add a feature that..." or "Now make it also..."

That's it. Every prompt you write will be one of these operations.

When you're stuck, ask yourself: "Which operation am I trying to do?" Then structure your prompt around that operation.

## Examples

| Operation | Example Prompt |
|-----------|----------------|
| CREATE | "Create a function that calculates shear stress" |
| READ | "Explain what this pandas code does" |
| EDIT | "Change this to use metric units" |
| FIX | "Debug this TypeError on line 23" |
| EXTEND | "Add a feature to export results to CSV" |

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Knowing these six operations gives you a vocabulary for working with AI. You're not just "asking AI to help" — you're performing specific operations that have specific patterns.
