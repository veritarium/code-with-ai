Sometimes you need to know when to stop refining and start fresh.

*Figure 8.1: The Decision — Refine or restart?*
{: .diagram-caption}

Here's a simple decision tree.

AI gave you output. It's not right. Ask yourself: **Is it close to what you want?**

**If YES → REFINE.** Give feedback, iterate, build on what you have.

Signs to refine:
- Structure is correct
- Small bugs or typos
- Missing one feature
- Style needs adjustment
- Logic is correct but incomplete

**If NO → RESTART.** New conversation, new prompt, fresh start.

Signs to restart:
- Wrong approach entirely
- Missing the point of the request
- Multiple fundamental problems
- Would need complete rewrite
- Going in circles (same errors repeating)

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Starting fresh isn't failure. It's efficiency. Sometimes the fastest path to working code is to abandon the current attempt and try again with a better prompt.

## The 5-Attempt Rule

Here's a simple rule: **Five attempts maximum, then restart.**

Look at the progression:

**Attempt 1: TRY** — Your initial prompt. See what happens.

**Attempt 2: REFINE** — Add more specifics. Clarify what's wrong.

**Attempt 3: ADJUST** — Fix errors. Try different wording.

**Attempt 4: REPHRASE** — Different approach. New angle on the problem.

**Attempt 5: LAST TRY** — Final attempt with everything you've learned.

If you're still not there after five attempts, **RESTART.** New conversation, better prompt, fresh context.

### Why Five?

**Too Few (1-2):** You're giving up too early. Missing easy fixes. Sometimes the solution is one more piece of information away.

**Just Right (3-5):** Enough attempts to find solutions. Not so many that you're wasting time spinning your wheels.

**Too Many (6+):** Diminishing returns. Context is getting cluttered. You're probably going in circles.

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> 5 attempts max, then start fresh with what you learned.

The beautiful thing about restarting is you're not starting from zero. You now know what doesn't work. Your second attempt will be better because of your first failure.
