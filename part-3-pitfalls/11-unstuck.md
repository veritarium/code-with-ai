Getting stuck is normal. Recognizing it early saves time.

## Warning Signs You're Stuck

- Same error keeps coming back
- Fixing one thing breaks another
- AI gives same answer repeatedly
- More than 5 attempts without progress
- Getting frustrated or confused

## What's Actually Happening

- Wrong mental model of the problem
- Missing crucial information
- Task is actually too complex
- Solving wrong problem entirely
- Context window exhausted

Here's what the stuck loop looks like:

**TRY → FAIL → TRY AGAIN → SAME FAIL → (back to TRY)**

You're going in circles. Each attempt looks slightly different but you're not actually making progress.

## Escape Routes

Six ways to get unstuck. Pick one based on your situation.

{: .chapter-diagram}
*Figure 11.2: Escape Routes — Six ways out*
{: .diagram-caption}

**1. START FRESH**
New conversation, new prompt. Clears context clutter. Fresh perspective.
*Use when: Same error keeps repeating.*

**2. BREAK SMALLER**
Task too big? Split it. Solve one piece at a time. Combine when working.
*Use when: Task seems impossible.*

**3. ADD CONTEXT**
Share more information. Full error messages. Related files, examples.
*Use when: AI seems confused about your situation.*

**4. REPHRASE**
Explain differently. Use different words. Focus on different aspect.
*Use when: AI misunderstands you.*

**5. ASK WHY**
Get AI to explain the error. "Why is this happening?" "What causes this?"
*Use when: You don't understand the error.*

**6. SIMPLIFY**
Make a minimal example. Strip to core problem. Add complexity later.
*Use when: Too many things could be wrong.*

## Quick Decision Guide

| Situation | Escape Route |
|-----------|--------------|
| Same error over and over | Start Fresh |
| Task seems impossible | Break Smaller |
| AI misunderstanding you | Rephrase |
| Don't understand error | Ask Why |
