Time to apply everything. Here's the approach.

**Start small, make it work, then expand.**

## Phase 1: PLAN

Define your goal. What should it do? What inputs/outputs? What's the simplest version?

Write it in one sentence before coding.

## Phase 2: BUILD

Work with AI. Start with core feature. Test as you go. Add features one by one.

Get it working before making it perfect.

## Phase 3: REFINE

Polish it. Handle edge cases. Add error messages. Clean up code.

Ask AI to review and improve.

### Example: Bolt Stress Calculator

**Plan:** "Calculate stress from force and area, warn if too high"

**Build:**
1. Create function
2. Add input
3. Add warning
4. Format output

**Refine:** Handle zero area, add units, save to file

Each step is small. Each step is testable. Each step gets you closer.

## Project Checklist

Before calling it done, verify everything.

*Figure 17.2: Project Checklist — Before you ship*
{: .diagram-caption}

### Before Starting

- [ ] Goal clearly defined?
- [ ] Inputs and outputs identified?
- [ ] Broken into small tasks?

### While Building

- [ ] Testing each piece?
- [ ] Understanding AI's code?
- [ ] Saving working versions?

### Before Finishing

- [ ] Works with normal input?
- [ ] Works with edge cases?
- [ ] Has clear error messages?

### Quality Check

- [ ] Code readable?
- [ ] Names descriptive?
- [ ] Comments where needed?

### Final Questions

- Can someone else use this without your help?
- Would you trust this code in production?

If yes to both, you're done.
