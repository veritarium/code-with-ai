## Growing Your Skills

Here's the progression from beginner to confident.

*Figure 18.1: Growing Your Skills — The progression*
{: .diagram-caption}

### Stage 1: COPY

- Follow AI's code exactly
- Ask for explanations
- Learn patterns

**Goal:** Get code working. Understand what it does.

### Stage 2: MODIFY

- Adjust AI's code yourself
- Combine pieces
- Fix small issues alone

**Goal:** Adapt solutions. Build on existing code.

### Stage 3: CREATE

- Design solutions
- Use AI as assistant
- Guide the process

**Goal:** Build anything. AI accelerates, not replaces.

You'll move through these stages naturally as you build more projects. Each project teaches you something new.

<strong>The Secret:</strong> Every expert was once a beginner who kept building. Growth = Practice + Curiosity + Persistence

*Figure 18.2: Resources — Where to get help*
{: .diagram-caption}

### AI Tools

- **Claude** (Anthropic) — Great for explanations
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) — Good for code generation
- **GitHub Copilot** — In-editor assistance

Use what works for you.

### Learning More

- **Python.org** — Official documentation
- **Stack Overflow** — Q&A for specific errors
- **YouTube tutorials** — Visual learning

Search when stuck.

### Practice Ideas

- Automate calculations (turn Excel work into code)
- Data visualization (create charts from data)
- File processing (batch convert/rename)

Solve real problems.

### When You're Stuck — The Workflow

1. Ask AI
2. Search Web
3. Rephrase
4. Break Down

Most problems solved in 1-2 steps.

## The Journey

Look how far you've come.

{: .chapter-diagram}
*Figure 18.3: The Journey — How far you've come*
{: .diagram-caption}

**You Started Here:** "I can't code"

**What You Learned:**
- The Loop: Describe → Get → Run → Evaluate
- Decomposition: Big tasks → Small tasks
- Communication: Specific prompts → Better results

**You Are Here:** "I build with AI"

**Skills You Now Have:**
- Read and understand code
- Communicate with AI effectively
- Debug and fix problems
- Build working solutions

**What's Next:**
- Pick a real problem you want to solve
- Build your first real project
- Share it with someone
- Then build another one!

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> You don't need to know everything to build something useful.
</div>

**The Truth About Coding:** Everyone looks things up. Everyone gets stuck. Everyone asks for help. The only difference is persistence.

## Key Takeaways

Everything in one page.

### YOU + AI = BUILDER

You provide direction and judgment. AI provides code and speed.

### Six Principles

1. **THE LOOP** — Describe → Get → Run → Evaluate. Iterate until it works.

2. **DECOMPOSE** — Big task → Small tasks. One sentence = right size.

3. **BE SPECIFIC** — Precise prompts → Better results. What, where, how, why, example.

4. **GIVE FEEDBACK** — Got X, Expected Y, Change Z. Tell AI what's wrong specifically.

5. **SHARE CONTEXT** — AI only knows what you tell it. Code, errors, constraints.

6. **KNOW WHEN TO RESTART** — 5 attempts, then fresh start. Cut losses and try again.

### The Formula for Success

**Clear Goal + Small Steps + Iteration + Persistence = Working Code**

<strong>You now have everything you need. Start building.</strong>
